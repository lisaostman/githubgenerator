# Github Generator

## The Short Version:
This code allows you to use node.js in order to create a portfolio pdf and html page based on your github account.

## More in-depth user control:
 * User is prompted to give their username and their favourite colour
 * This choice is then used to fetch their username using axios and their favourite color determines the colours of the pdf/html file
 * fs is utilised to generate the html for the file
